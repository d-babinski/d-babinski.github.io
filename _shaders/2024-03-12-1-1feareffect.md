This is a project I've worked on for over 2 years at Megapixel Studio. I've joined as second game developer after the preproduction phase in march 2021 and have worked on it till july 2023. I've participated in the whole process eventually becoming the only gameplay developer as the project lead took more of a management and optimization role. I've took part in every possible aspect of game creation beside release.
