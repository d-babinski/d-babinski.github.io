This is game created for United Game Jam 2020 with theme "Two". The game is a duel against a boss that is made of two creatures. Jam contained mostly beginners (it only allowed people that didn't jam before) and a very active community. Out of 300 comissions Ghoulash has been 4th most played game with tens of reviews from fellow gamedevs. Usually to hard to beat on first time after few tries most of people were able to get through the fight which seems like well balanced design.

During the jam I've learned:
- construction of basic AI
- applying mechanics to a boss in a way that it's entertaining
- sprite rigging
- working with collisions
- how fun gamedev really is

What went wrong:
- I have not used in-built Unity's reset scene functionality and it took 4 hours to implement reset by code
- approximately half of the people preferred keyboard direction instead of mouse position and I didn't offer a choice
- I've had many problems with tile grid and I haven't resolved it, just worked around


Overall the jam was great and here's the game hosted on (itch.io)[https://flushedale.itch.io/goulash].
