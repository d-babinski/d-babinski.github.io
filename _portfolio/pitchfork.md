This is a game created for GMTK Game Jam 2020 with theme "out of control" in 48 hours by a team of 5. It is essentially a game about not being able to play game due to annoying pop ups up to the point where the pop ups become actual gameplay. We've advertised the game as RPG with quests as a part of game idea. Additionally game becomes more and more distorted in it's sounds and graphics as it progresses (achieveing psychodelic and tiring effect). We've created many short minigames which are usually about "There is no correct answer" with many questions or tasks to do.

During the development we've managed to:
- design precisely all of the intended mechanics
- implement most of minigames
- use xml structure for feeding the content
- implement procedural audio relative to the gamestate (pop ups appearing and some types of pop ups create additional melody of soundtrack)
- finish the art part of the game really early

What have not worked for us:
- we haven't finished audio for the main menu buttons
- some of the mini games have placeholder text (funnily enough it still fits the idea)
- we've been really stressed cause we've submitted the game in last 2 mins of the submission time

This is honestly the best jam I've partaken and all of the team members worked hard through 2 days and nights. The game is available [here](https://marcwerk.itch.io/pitchfork-of-destiny-a-slimy-adventure).
