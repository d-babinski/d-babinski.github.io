This is a project I've worked on for over 2 years at Megapixel Studio. I've joined as second game developer after the preproduction phase in march 2021 and have worked on it till july 2023. I've participated in the whole process eventually becoming the only gameplay developer as the project lead took more of a management and optimization role. I've took part in every possible aspect of game creation beside release.

Some of my responsibilties were:

- implementation of gameplay from the concept phase to the final mechanics or system (including bossfights, puzzles, and custom gameplay elements),
- project and implementation of a complete menu, settings, HUD, in collaboration with a concept artist,
- developing tools for designers for easier gameplay flow design.
- design and implementation of enemy entities and their AI,
- design and implementation of a sound system from scratch using FMOD for easier sound control and simplicity of use across all projects in the company,
- design and implementation of a spatial sound system taking into account the level geometry and obstruction of the source based on the state of dynamic elements (e.g., doors and their degree of opening),
- working with pathfinding, including modification of the navmesh caused by in-game events.
- maintenance and bugfixing of the project and preparing for milestones,
- deployment and supervision of new team members.
- basic preparation of the project for porting to the Xbox platform,
