This is game created for Weekly Game Jam with theme "Pilot". It's simple physics based prototype about making vehicles by connecting modules. After creating the vehicle it's then used to gather more and more resources up to the point when it can fly towards the sky for long enough to reach 1000 meters. Initialy project contained 5 people but 3 of them lacked motivation to get past initial phase so we've decided to do project with me and artist only. The game has came to life in little over one day.

What we've managed to acomplish across about 24 hours:
- working module interaction and building
- gameplay loop
- simple procedural level generation

What have not worked:
- initial scope was too big so game couldn't get polished
- game was hard to explain quickly due to robust interactions
- we've forgot to loop the soundtrack

Game is available to play on my [itch.io](https://flushedale.itch.io/some-day-well-fly).
